I am a Research Associate at Cardiff's School of Journalism, Media and Culture and the [Data Justice Lab](https://datajusticelab.org/). I joined the University of Cardiff with the European Research Council project [DATAJUSTICE](https://datajusticeproject.net/), directed by [Lina Dencik](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/182924-dencik-lina). My current research aims to fill the knowledge gap between social and media researchers and technology as well as to perform technological auditing and design proposals in the intersection of intelligent information systems and social justice.

I hold a PhD. in Computer Science from the University of Granada (PhD Thesis Dissertation is available [here](publication/sanchez-monedero-2013-phd-thesis/)) and I have been an Associate Professor at the University of Córdoba and the University Loyola Andalucía and a Research Intern at Real-Time Innovations (US).  I worked on several projects involving distributed systems and machine learning. My last projects were with the AYRNA research group at the University of Córdoba targeting problems of biomedicine, renewable energy and climatology among others. I am the author of [journal and conference papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hWWO9LAAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao) with contributions in evolutionary computation, artificial neural networks, kernel methods and ordinal regression models and recently, in critical digital studies. I am the co-author of free (as in freedom) scientific software [ORCA](https://github.com/ayrna/orca) with Pedro A. Gutiérrez and María Pérez-Ortiz. [Former website](https://www.uco.es/~i02samoj/) at the University of Córdoba.

I am Research Associate at Cardiff\'s School of Journalism, Media and Culture and the [Data Justice Lab](https://datajusticelab.org/). I joined the University of Cardiff with the European Research Council project [DATAJUSTICE](https://datajusticeproject.net/), directed by [Lina Dencik](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/182924-dencik-lina). With a background in Computer Science, my current research aims at filling the knowledge gap between social and media researchers and technology as well as to perform technological auditing and design proposals in the intersection of intelligent information systems and social justice.

I hold a PhD. in Computer Science from University of Granada and I have been Associate Professor at University of Córdoba and University Loyola Andalucía and Research Intern at Real-Time Innovations (US).  I worked in several projects involving distributed systems and machine learning. My last projects were with [AYRNA](http://www.uco.es/grupos/ayrna/index.php/en) research group at University of Córdoba (Spain) targeting problems of biomedicine, renewable energy and climatology among others. I am author of several [journal and conference papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hWWO9LAAAAAJ&hl=es&oi=ao) with contributions in evolutionary computation, artificial neural networks, kernel methods and ordinal regression models and critical digital studies. I am co-author of free (as in freedom) scientific software [ORCA](https://github.com/ayrna/orca) with Pedro A. Gutiérrez and María Pérez-Ortiz.

abstract: "To build distributed applications using DDS for large scenarios typically involves a big number of individual processes running on many computers spread on the network. In this presentation we propose a new approach for defining, configuring, and deploying DDS applications. Instead of a programmatic approach, our system is based on XML. We show how to define a flexible XML-based language to describe the DDS entities and their associated QoS as well as how they should be deployed on the network. In addition, we will report preliminary tests and lessons learned in using this new methodology."
